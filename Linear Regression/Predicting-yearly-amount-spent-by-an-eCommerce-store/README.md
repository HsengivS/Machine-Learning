# LINEAR-REGRESSION

## Linear Regression using Python

### Predicting-the-yearly-spent-amount-for-e-Commerce-store-using-Linear-Regression

* The objective here is to build a Linear regression model which will help an eCommerce store to enhance their Business Process.
* An eCommerce store, which sells clothing and fabric materials wants to know whether their customers are making the purchase through web application or through mobile application and also want to find their yearly amount spent by them.
* From this we can say that it is regression problem, because the yearly amount spent (target variable) is a continuous variable.
* Kindly follow the ipynb notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis and the model Building.
* Hope this book helps. Thank you.
